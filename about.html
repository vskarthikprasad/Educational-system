          <p>
              In the continuous pursuit of academic excellence and creating a student-friendly learning environment, VIT introduced the Fully Flexible Credit System (Shortly referred to as FFCS).FFCS is a way in which a student has complete freedom in tailoring his course the way he wishes. It accommodates the wants and needs of the entire student community as a whole. With this system, a student can prepare his/her own timetable with the specific courses he/she intends to do in that semester along with the timings of classes and choice of professors. Learning has never been this fun. Students have the flexibility to pursue their other interests in sports or club activities and scheduling classes accordingly will take it a long way.It is a beautiful system that is tailor made to suit all the kinds of students with all learning needs, whether someone wishes to complete subjects early or pursue subjects of other branches for acquiring a Minor/Honours degree. In addition, this system ensures offerings of subjects from all disciplines encouraging students to pursue multiple interests and develop themselves wholly.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>This is a system that VIT proudly boasts about in every brochure or advertisement that this is a system that allows students to choose their own faculty, their own subject slots, class timings and locations. You give your first FFCS for the courses of II and onward semesters. In the I Semester, VIT itself chooses the faculty, subject slots, class timings and locations for you.</p>
